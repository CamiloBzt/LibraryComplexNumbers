# Complex Library

This project has some different functions to perform some operations between complex numbers.


###This library has functions like:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Module
- Conjugated
- Phase
- Convert from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates
- Convert from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates

```
a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]
function_name(a, b)
a and b must be arrays
```

## Getting Started

- You have to clone this library for using it in your PC.
- Then you have to move it to the folder you want.



- Cloning the library

You have to write this in your Git cmd(If you do not have Git on your computer you can install it [Here](https://git-scm.com/))
```git bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CamiloBzt/LibraryComplexNumbers.git
```

In this moment you will have the repository in your PC

### Prerequisites

- You will need to have instaled Python 3.8 in your computer

Here is a link where you can download and install it:

[Python Official Page](https://python.org/)

- Be sure you have the library is in the same folder of the project you want to implement it.


## Running the tests

For running the predetermined test you have to open the file **unitTest.py** and then just run it, then it will show you the results from the tests.
